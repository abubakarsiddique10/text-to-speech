        <!-- My name is Sam. I am a student. I have a daily routine. I do everything according to this routing. I get up
        early in the
        morning. I wash my face. Then I go for a walk with my father. -->

        When I come back. I take a bath. then I have my breakfast. After breakfast, I brush my teeth and go to school.

        <!-- I always reach school on time. I attend all my classes. Then I come back home at 4 pm. In the afternoon, I play
        football
        or cricket with friends. -->

        <!-- In the evening, I study for some time. Then I watch TV. After supper, I go to bed. I follow my daily routine strictly.
        But On holidays the routine is different. -->

        <!-- Sometimes, I visit the zoo with my parents, and other times, I spend time at my relatives' house. However, I
        never break
        the golden rule of 'early to bed and early to rise'. -->
